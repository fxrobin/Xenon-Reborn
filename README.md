The main goal of this project is to offer a basic framework to implement an old school shoot-them-up game. 
Rookies can practice algorithm and basic Java programming to acquire developement skills.

This framework is based on LibGDX and runs only on a desktop computer (Java SE 8) until now.

"XenonReborn" is a classic gradle generated by the LibGdx config tool.

Here is how the v0.1.8 looks like (Youtube) (just click on the image to launch the video)
